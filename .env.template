# (optional) used when tracking new events that need to be back-indexed, but not wanting to stop the indexer
# - type "back" or "race":
#   - back indexing starts a parallel indexer that stops when it reaches the last outdated block
#   - race indexing starts a parallel indexer that takes over the regular indexer when overcome
# - diff should be a list of event names added for indexing (reindexing only adds events, never removes)
# - name should uniquely represent the reindexing
